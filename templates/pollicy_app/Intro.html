        The growth of internet users has brought about social and economic benefits on a global scale. 
        However, significant harms such as online violence, disinformation, and hate speech have also 
        proliferated in these online spaces. 
        Discriminatory gendered practices are shaped by social, economic, cultural, and political structures 
        in the physical world and are similarly reproduced online across digital platforms.

        Uganda, too, has experienced rising rates of online harassment targeting both women in public 
        life as well as everyday users.
        Online violence manifests during periods of political activity, and, when directed at 
        women in public life and political discourse, is an example of Violence Against Women in 
        Politics (VAW-P) (NDI, 2019). It is, therefore, referred to as<span class="intro-span"> 
        Online Violence Against Women in Politics (OVAW-P)</span>.

        In order to understand how this report sought to identify and analyze the scale of online 
        violence targeted at women political candidates and high-profile individuals during the 
        January 2021 General Election in Uganda. 
        The report also sought to determine how this online harassment might impact their use of social 
        media platforms for political activity during the elections.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
        For this purpose, we identified and monitored the accounts of 152 nominated candidates and 
        50 high-profile individuals during the campaign and election period on the two most widely 
        used public platforms, Facebook and Twitter. Methodologies used include lexicon building focus 
        group discussions, data scraping of publicly available profiles, qualitative data analysis, 
        and development of a Machine Learning (ML) model to identify and tag instances of OVAWP in 
        both English and Luganda.
